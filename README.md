# Campus Connect

Campus Connect is a student utility app built with Flutter.  
It helps university and college students stay organized with events, announcements, notes, and personal details in one place.  
The focus was on clean UI/UX, with basic local functionality. Some backend parts are planned for future but not required at this stage.
